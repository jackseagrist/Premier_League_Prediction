## Introduction
Our prediction model makes use of a Poisson Distribution i.e. when we know the average number of times an event will happen, we can use Poisson to calculate how likely other numbers deviate from this average.

Using data from the 2018/2019 season, we will predict how likely a match scenario is that the user provides.
